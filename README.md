# 🚀 Welcome to the Tech Department Onboarding

### Your first mission

Welcome to the team! Before we start building complex apps and robots, we need to set up our communication lines.

In the software world, we don't email code to each other. We use **Git** and **GitHub**. This repository is your "playground" to learn the workflow we will use for our actual projects.

## 🎯 The Objective
Your goal is simple: **Add your name to the `members` folder.**

By doing this, you will learn the three pillars of our workflow:
1.  **Forking:** Copying a project so you can work on it safely.
2.  **Committing:** Saving your changes.
3.  **Pull Request (PR):** Asking the team to accept your work.

### Step 2: Create Your File
1.  In your new forked repo, look for the folder named `members`. Click it.
2.  Click **Add file** > **Create new file**.
3.  Name the file: `YourFirstName_YourLastName.md` (Example: `bensmaine_mohamed.md`).
